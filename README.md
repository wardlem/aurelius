# Aurelius template engine

This repository contains the Aurelius template language.
The engine was built primarily to work well with [Incremental DOM](https://github.com/google/incremental-dom), though it also supports static HTML.

## Status

This project is currently alpha software of development and may contain bugs or problems with the implementation.
If you find any problems, please report them as a Github issue and they will be addressed in short order.

## Installation

You can install this software to be used in your project with NPM:

```
npm i --save @potient/aurelius
```

There currently no `cli` interface, though one is likely to be built sometime in the near future.

## Usage

Coming soon...
